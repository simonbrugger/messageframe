# The message frame
I like to create personal valentine's gifts and I love to play around with all kind of electronic boards, resistors and sensors. So I came up with this idea sending love messages to my wife not to her smart phone or email account. I want to create a physical device that receives the messages and displays them. This physical device is a picture frame with a 8x8 LED matrix controled by an IoT board which receives the messages or symbols I entered on a website. 

First I wanted to call this project "Love frame" but it's to cheesy and at the end the frame displays only messages. So I end up with "Message Frame" as project name. In this tutorial I describe step by step how I created the message frame and feel free to fork the code or contribute ideas.
